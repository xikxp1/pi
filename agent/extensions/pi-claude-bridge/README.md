# pi-claude-bridge

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/pi-claude-bridge)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pi-claude-bridge)

Pi extension that integrates Claude Code via the [Agent SDK](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-typescript). Based initially on [claude-agent-sdk-pi](https://github.com/prateekmedia/claude-agent-sdk-pi) by Prateek Sunal. This fork adds streaming, MCP tool bridging, custom pi tool bridging, session resume/persistence, context sync, thinking support, skills forwarding, and the AskClaude tool.

1. **Provider** — Use Opus/Sonnet/Haiku as models in pi, with all tool calls flowing through pi's TUI
2. **AskClaude tool** — Delegate tasks or questions to Claude Code when using another provider


**FYI:** Anthropic [announced and then unannounced](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/15036540-use-the-claude-agent-sdk-with-your-claude-plan) a change to how you would be billed for tools that use the Agent SDK like this one. As of June 15, 2026 it uses subscription quota just like Claude Code direct does.

## Install

```
pi install npm:pi-claude-bridge
```

## Provider

Use `/model` to select `claude-bridge/claude-fable-5`, `claude-bridge/claude-opus-5`, `claude-bridge/claude-opus-4-8`, `claude-bridge/claude-opus-4-7`, `claude-bridge/claude-opus-4-6`, `claude-bridge/claude-sonnet-5`, `claude-bridge/claude-sonnet-4-6`, or `claude-bridge/claude-haiku-4-5`.

Behind the scenes, pi's tools are bridged to Claude Code but it should all work like normal in pi. Bash commands get a 120-second default timeout (matching Claude Code's default) since pi's bash has no timeout by default. Skills in pi are copied over to Claude Code's system prompt so should work as they would with any other pi provider.

**1M Context:** Opus 5, Opus 4.7, and Opus 4.8 get 1M context by default. Opus 4.6 only gets 1M if you're on a Max plan or pay for Extra Usage. Sonnet 4.6 only gets 1M if you pay for Extra Usage. You will need to set `provider.plan` and/or `provider.longContextExtraUsage` for 1M context in Opus 4.6/Sonnet 4.6 as described in [Configuration](#configuration).

## AskClaude Tool

Available when using any non-claude-bridge provider. Pi's LLM can delegate tasks to Claude Code and wait for it to answer a question or perform a task. Examples of how to use:

- "Ask Claude to plan a fix"
- "If you get stuck, ask claude for help"
- "Ask claude to review the plan in @foo.md, implement it, then ask an isolated=true claude to review the implementation"
- "Ask claude to poke holes in this theory"
- "Find all the places in the codebase that handle auth"

You could also create skills or add something to AGENTS.md to e.g. "Always call Ask Claude to review complicated feature implementations before considering the task complete."

### Parameters

- **`prompt`** — the question or task for Claude Code
- **`mode`** — `read` (default, read files and search/fetch on web), `none`, or `full` (read+write+bash, disable this mode with `allowFullMode: false` in config)
- **`model`** — `opus` (default), `sonnet`, `haiku`, or a full model ID
- **`thinking`** — effort level: `off`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`
- **`isolated`** — when `true`, Claude gets a clean session with no conversation history (default: `false`)

## Configuration

Config: `~/.pi/agent/claude-bridge.json` (global) or the project Pi config directory, usually `.pi/claude-bridge.json` (project; merged over global).

```json
{
  "askClaude": {
    "enabled": true,
    "allowFullMode": true,
    "defaultIsolated": false,
    "description": "Custom tool description override"
  },
  "provider": {
    "plan": "max",
    "longContextExtraUsage": false,
    "strictMcpConfig": true,
    "pathToClaudeCodeExecutable": "/home/you/.nix-profile/bin/claude"
  }
}
```

`askClaude`:
- `enabled` — register the AskClaude tool (default `true`)
- `name` — override the tool's pi-side name (default `"AskClaude"`)
- `label` — override the TUI label (default `"Ask Claude Code"`)
- `description` — override the tool description. Default when `allowFullMode: true`: *"Delegate to Claude Code for a second opinion or analysis (code review, architecture questions, debugging theories), or to autonomously handle a task. Defaults to read-only mode — use full mode when the user wants to delegate a task that requires changes. Prefer to handle straightforward tasks yourself."*
- `defaultMode` — `"read"` (default), `"none"`, or `"full"`
- `defaultIsolated` — start each call in a fresh session (default `false`)
- `allowFullMode` — allow `mode: "full"`; set `false` to lock it out
- `appendSkills` — forward pi's skills block into the system prompt (default `true`)

`provider`:
- `plan` (default `"pro"`) — set to `"max"` for Max (or Team Premium/Enterprise) to enable Opus 4.6 with 1M context.
- `longContextExtraUsage` — set to `true` to enable 1M models that cost money through Extra Usage. It enables Sonnet 4.6 with 1M on every plan and Opus 4.6 with 1M on Pro. Not needed for Opus 4.7 or 4.8.
- `appendSystemPrompt` — append pi's AGENTS.md and skills (default `true`)
- `settingSources` — CC filesystem settings to load; only applied when `appendSystemPrompt: false`
- `strictMcpConfig` — block MCP servers from `~/.claude.json` / `.mcp.json` (default `true`). Cloud MCP (Gmail/Drive via claude.ai OAuth) is always blocked.
- `pathToClaudeCodeExecutable` — path to the `claude` binary. Useful if your OS/filesystem has the SDK's bundled musl/glibc binaries in a place where they can't run. For example, with Nix you can set the binary to e.g. `"/home/you/.nix-profile/bin/claude"`.


**Extension providers and models.json:** pi's `modelOverrides` in `~/.pi/agent/models.json` do not currently apply to extension-registered providers (like claude-bridge). Overriding `contextWindow` or other fields requires editing `src/models.ts` directly.

## Tests

`npm run test:unit` for offline tests (`tests/unit-*.mjs`: queue, import, skills). 

`npm test` for the full suite, which adds integration tests that hit APIs (`tests/int-*.{sh,mjs}`: smoke, multi-turn, cache, session-resume, session-rebuild, tool-message). Set `CLAUDE_BRIDGE_TESTING_ALT_MODEL` in `.env.test` for the alt-provider smoke test (e.g. `openrouter/z-ai/glm-4.7-flash`).

## Debugging

Set `CLAUDE_BRIDGE_DEBUG=1` to enable debug output:

- **Bridge log** at `~/.pi/agent/claude-bridge.log` — every provider call, session sync decision, tool result delivery, and CC's stderr. Override location with `CLAUDE_BRIDGE_DEBUG_PATH`.
- **Per-query Claude Code CLI logs** at `~/.pi/agent/cc-cli-logs/<timestamp>-<tag>-<seq>.log` — the CC subprocess's own debug stream, one file per `query()` call. Tags are `provider` (main turn), `continuation` (steer replay), or `askclaude` (sub-delegation). Useful when a resume fails or CC misbehaves internally — shows the CLI's own view of session loading, API requests, and tool calls.

When filing a bug about a session-resume failure (e.g. "No conversation found"), the most useful attachments are the `syncResult:` lines from the bridge log plus the matching `cc-cli-logs/` file for the failing query.

## Maintenance

After a Claude Code release, review `MODE_DISALLOWED_TOOLS` in `src/index.ts` — it gates which CC tools the AskClaude subagent may invoke per mode (`read` / `full` / `none`). Add new agentic tools (PlanMode, Task spawning, etc.) to the appropriate mode lists if they shouldn't be available to subagents.
